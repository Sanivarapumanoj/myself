## Introduction

The project leverages machine learning techniques to classify messages as positive or negative or neutral. This README provides essential information for using and understanding the project.

## Features

- Text classification: The classifier is capable of analyzing and categorizing text messages as positive or negative or neutral.
- Machine Learning: The project uses machine learning models, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or deep learning, to perform the classification.
- Customization: The project allows for customization, including the use of different algorithms and parameter tuning for improved performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn (for data analysis and visualization), Tfidf.

## Usage

1. Data Preparation: Prepare your dataset. The tweets Collection Dataset is a common choice for setiment classification tasks. Make sure your dataset is appropriately formatted.

2. Model Building: Choose a machine learning algorithm, preprocess the data, and build a classification model. Example code for this can be found in the project's code files.

3. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using relevant metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
